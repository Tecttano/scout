Goal:
A CLI-native recon tool for Linux that takes a domain or IP and runs basic recon modules, outputs clean results to screen or file. Looks and acts like a real Linux tool, not a toy.

V1 Scope (Minimum Viable Tool):
Input Handling (Python argparse)
* Accept --domain or --ip
* Support --quick, --full, -o for output

Modules to Build:
* whois (domain info)
* dig or DNS resolve (A/CNAME/NS/MX records)
* ping (basic reachability)

* nmap (top 1000 ports or specific ones)
* http_headers (grab headers if HTTP is up)

Output:
* Clean terminal output (colored later)
* Optional save to output.txt

Structure:
* scout.py as main file
* Folder modules/ with files like dns.py, scan.py, etc.
* utils.py for shared stuff
